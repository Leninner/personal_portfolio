## Introduction

A **load balancing** system is a system that distributes incoming network traffic `across multiple servers`. This ensures no single server bears too much demand. By spreading the work evenly, load balancing improves application responsiveness. It also increases availability of applications and websites for users. Load balancing is performed by an algorithm `known as a load balancer`. 

The load balancer distributes incoming client requests to computing resources such as application servers and databases. It also ensures availability and performance by monitoring the health of applications and only sending requests to servers and applications that can respond in a timely manner.

In AWS, you can use **Elastic Load Balancing** to automatically distribute incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions. 

It can handle the varying load of your application traffic in a **single** Availability Zone or **across multiple** Availability Zones. Elastic Load Balancing offers three types of load balancers that all feature the high availability, automatic scaling, and robust security necessary to make your applications fault tolerant.

### Load Balancer Types

Elastic Load Balancing supports these types of load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers and Classic Load Balancers.

**Application Load Balancer** 

- Best suited for load balancing of **HTTP and HTTPS traffic** and provides advanced request routing targeted at the delivery of modern application architectures, including microservices and containers. 
- Operating at the individual request level **(Layer 7)**.
- Application Load Balancer routes traffic to targets within **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)** based on the content of the request.

**Network Load Balancer** 

- Best suited for load balancing of Transmission Control Protocol **(TCP)**, User Datagram Protocol **(UDP)**, and Transport Layer Security **(TLS)** traffic where extreme performance is required. 
- Operating at the connection level **(Layer 4)**. 
- Network Load Balancer routes traffic to targets within **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)** and is capable of handling millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies.

**Classic Load Balancer** 

- Provides basic load balancing across multiple Amazon EC2 instances and operates at both the request level and connection level. Classic Load Balancer is intended for applications that were built within the EC2-Classic network.

## Architecture

![Architecture](/images/load-balancing-aws/architecture.png)

In the above architecture, we have a load balancer that distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances. You can add and remove instances from your load balancer as your needs change, without disrupting the overall flow of requests to your application.

### Requirements

- An AWS account and AWS CLI configured on your computer
- Some knowledge about AWS services like EC2, VPC, IAM, etc.
- A basic knowledge of Linux commands
- CDK and SAM CLI installed on your computer

## Implementation

For this project I will be using two approaches:

- [Using SAM CLI](#using-sam-cli)
- [Using CDK](#using-cdk)

These two approaches are very similar, but the CDK approach is more flexible and powerful. You may choose the approach that best suits your needs.

### Using SAM CLI

### Using CDK

## Conclusion

Load balancing is an important concept in cloud computing. It helps to distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers. In this project, we have created a load balancing system with EC2 instances and CDK.

CDK is a fantastic tool that allows you to create infrastructure as code. It is an open source software development framework to model and provision your cloud application resources using familiar programming languages. In this project, we have used CDK to create a load balancing system with EC2 instances.
